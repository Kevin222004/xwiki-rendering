//  is not supposed to be one. This is a bad design since a non-component should not extend a component (it's dangerous
//  - @Inject-ed component will not be injected, and the extending class will inherit the @Component annotation, which
//  is bad - imagine for example that in the future we auto-generate components.txt based on the @Component annotation).
